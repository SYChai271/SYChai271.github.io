            <p>
              Hi, my name is Shao Yang. As an eager learner, I hope to expand my
              knowledge especially in the field of Math and Science. I enjoy
              learning about the newest technology and I do my best to be
              up-to-date with the latest developments, be it Artificial
              Intelligence, robotics, or anything in between. I am innovative
              and can come up with effective solutions to address new problems
              that may arise.

                In my free time, I enjoy doing several activities such as
                programming, gaming with friends as well as listening to music.
                My passion for programming and creating useful tools prompted me
                to join the Robotics Club CCA in secondary school. There, I was
                able to continue to develop this interest and I was also able to
                take up various leadership positions, most notably, CCA
                Vice-Chairperson.

                      Chess is one of my favourite passtimes as it helps me
                      develop my problem solving abilities as well as my
                      critical thinking. This is why I decided that I wanted to
                      make a replica of the board game from scratch using
                      python. This was my first big project that I endeavoured
                      on at that point in time so the prospect of building the
                      entire app ground up seemed overwhelming to me initially.
                      Indeed, it was no easy task and my abilities were pushed
                      to their limit in order for me to figure out solutions to
                      all sorts of bugs that had arised along the way. In
                      hindsight, there were certain aspects of my code that
                      could receive some cleaning up as well as a few bugs that
                      needed to be taken care of, but for the most part, the
                      game is functional and I was glad that I did not give up
                      midway as this journey has been very rewarding and
                      fruitful.

                      This was my first web developemnet project after learning
                      the fundamentals. This website was designed to showcase my
                      groups's research and ideas for the 23rd Elementz Science
                      Research Conference & Exhibition. In this project, I
                      applied many concepts which I had learnt such as building
                      a responsive layout using bootstrap, as well as learning
                      how to style images via CSS. This experience has been very
                      fulfilling as I was able to upgrade my web development
                      skills while at the same time playing my part for the
                      team.

                      Due to the pandemic, I was unable to compete in any
                      robotics competition in 2020, which makes this the first
                      robotics competition I took part in. Although I had
                      received training and had attempted numerous practices,
                      none of which was able to be compared with the scale and
                      difficulty of the WRO missions. Needless to say, I had
                      made uncountable mistakes during the preparation for this
                      competition mainly due to my inexperience. For instance,
                      rather than taking my time and brainstorming plausible
                      solutions, I jumped straight into it with my initial idea
                      which I was optimistic about, but after several weeks of
                      testing, I realised that my prototype was not going to cut
                      it. It was difficult to go back to square one and start
                      over but I understood that it was necessary in order for
                      me to have any hopes of improving. This competition taught
                      me the importance of perserverance; to have the urge to
                      continue despite mutliple setbacks which I had faced when
                      the robot was performing inconsistently. It was only after
                      countless hours of hardwork did I managed to overcome
                      these difficulties. In terms of skills, I learnt many new
                      algorithms like PID line tracing, various search and sort
                      algorithms and even implemented depth first search to find
                      the shortest path.

                      This was another website that I made to showcase our teams
                      proposal for a platform to encourage citizens to indulge
                      in home gardening, in hopes of attaining the 30by30 goal.
                      Similar to the Avis Fashion website, this was also made
                      using bootstrap and vanilla CSS. Additionally, I was able
                      to include some javascript which I had learnt along the
                      way to enhance the user experience of the website. This
                      continued my interest for building websites and prompted
                      me to learn more about back-end web development.

                      The 2022 mission was radically different from that of
                      2021. There were many more elements demanding greater
                      expertise in the engineering of robot to enable to it
                      cross obstacles and perform precise actions. Compared to
                      the previous year, the tasks this year were more
                      challenging in terms of building. Upon realising this, I
                      could not help but feel slightly nervous as my building
                      was not as well-rounded as my programming. Nonetheless, I
                      felt that this was a good opportunity to step out of my
                      comfort zone and try out something new and build
                      innovative mechanisms and experiment with different robot
                      bases. Designing a good robot is a multifaceted process
                      that requires understanding in various physics topics such
                      as centre of gravity as well as the principles of moments
                      to enable the robot to perform the tasks with ease, which
                      I felt that I had accomplished. In terms of programming, I
                      was able to design an algorithm to allow the robot to
                      sense objects accurately while moving at high speeds to
                      save time. This led me employ statstics functions like
                      mean and median as well as standard deviation to calculate
                      the optimal sensor reading for evaluation to yield the
                      most reliable results. Furthermore, there were other
                      creative ideas I tried such as using the PID algorithm to
                      control the distance of the robot from the wall rather
                      than for line tracing as there was a lack of lines on the
                      playing field. This method turned out to be very feasible
                      as it was efficacious in maintaining the consistency and
                      positioning of the robot.
